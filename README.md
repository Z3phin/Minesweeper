# Minesweeper
Sweeping mines with a broom! No there's no broom actually. They do get a bit dusty though.

## Description
This is a version of Minesweeper implemented with JavaFX. 

To run this program in your IDE, you will need to have the JavaFX library installed.

I have made several versions of this now. The first was implemented using C#, and then another version in Java using JavaFX, which is different to this one.
This project is a remake of that previous Java version, with complete features and a nicer UI (the last version had no win state!).
